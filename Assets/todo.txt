commit:

todo:
    level editor and level editor UI
    use same classes for level editor and real game (if doing in 3d)
    when no more movement points, automatically set current ability to action
    stop searching for walkable if hole

notes:
    hearts can be stuck forever in corner if no puller/swapper

ideas:
    be able to choose how agents are layed out at the start of the game on set of predetermined cells (should be invisible to other player)
    play two units in one turn
    units that just killed another unit gets a bonus? ex: +1 movement point
    map editor....?
