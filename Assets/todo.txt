commit:
    highlight button to show what is the current action
    differentiate visual range between move and action

todo:
    when no more movement points, automatically set current ability to action

ideas:
    once one agent was moved, selection is locked on this agent, player must play action or pass turn
    be able to choose how agents are layed out at the start of the game on set of predetermined cells (should be invisible to other player)
